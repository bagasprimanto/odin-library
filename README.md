# The Library project
In this project I built a Library of books by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, specifically exercising Object constructors and prototypical inheritance from JavaScript.

You can:
* Add books
* Remove books
* Set which books you have read / not read

Try it yourself!

## What I Learned
In this project I learned the following:

* Used JavaScript object constructors to neatly group information regarding objects (books) together
* Used prototypical inheritance to create a common method among objects
